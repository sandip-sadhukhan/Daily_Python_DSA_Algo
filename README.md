# Daily List of solving problems

This is the public repo, where I will try to solve 5 questions daily to improve my data structure and algorithm knowledge in python.

## Why Python

C++ and Java are considered most used programming language in competitive programming. But in development I used **Django**, Which is a python based web framework. So, python is the backend language I used. That is the reason, why I choose python as a language.

## Problem List

I am following the list made by **Apna College** Youtube Channel. Here is the [Video Link](https://youtu.be/u6Xsayqxij0), which you can check out. They made a 375 question list which is need to completed in 2.5 months with solving daily 5 questions.
